	<h1> The Land </h1>
		<p style="text-align:center">    Poet: Shravya Bhaskara</p>
	<p class="p1">    No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,
		<br>The ship was still as she could be, 
		<br>She was huge and made of iron and wood, 
		<br>Carrying atleast two-a-thousand as she could. <br>
		
		<br>The sun in the heaven was shining bright,
		<br>The captain said, "Take a bite, 
		<br>We shall make it to the Land, 
		<br>Let the ship sing its band."<br>
		
		<br>Two-a-hundered men as they sang, 
		<br>The ship roared over the sea with its gang. 
		<br>All the men young and old joined, 
		<br>The gods in the heaven were too overjoyed. <br>
		
		<br>There was such music in the air,
		<br>That none had known of despair.
		<br>Little had they known the perils at sea,
		<br>As each of them drank their tea.<br>
	
		<br>But Khronos was cruel as he could be,
		<br>He let them sing and admire the sea.
		<br>The bright day turned hazy and dark,
		<br>And the sound was nothing like a lark.<br>
	
		<br>In the middle of the sea as they were,
		<br>The huge storm came over.
		<br>Each wave twice as big,
		<br>Came down with force upon the brig.<br>
	
		<br>The men were like ants,
		<br>Shouting now and then "We can't".
		<br>But the sea wouldn't hear, it was too strong,
		<br>And the rocks underneath awaited the throng.<br>
	
		<br> As the ship hit a rock,
		<br>The deck shook, and out fell the stock.
		<br>With the stock fell the man,
		<His cry to the heaven, all in vain.<br>
	
		<br>Each of them held on to a piece of wood,
		<br>Like it was the last of their livelihood.
		<br>They swam for the land,
		<br>Lettng out each other a hand.<br>
	
		<br>The ship was now sunk to the brim,
		<br>If only they knew in which direction to swim.
		<br>Two-a-hundered at once she swallowed,
		<br>Leaving but a girl, neither too young nor too old.<br>
	
		<br>She held onto a piece of wood,
		<br>Crying out for help as loud as she could.
		<br>The wood floated with the waves,
		<br>And so she found her way to the caves.<br>
	
		<br>In the caves, she found a family at last,
		<br>Each of them had the same past.
		<br>They took her in at once as they knew,
		<br>The pain and suffering of loneliness was nothing new.<br></p1>
