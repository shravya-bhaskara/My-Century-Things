# [My Century Things](https://shravya-bhaskara.github.io/My-Century-Things/)

I am Shravya Bhasakara, an under-graduate Electronics and Communications Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I am also a Binary Exploitation enthusiast and a CTF player at Team Bi0s, ranked #1 CTF team in India, and Team Shakti (a women-only CTF team), ranked #15 in India.

I am hard working, diligent, persistent, committed and motivated and believe that with the right amount of passion and yearn for knowledge, one can can achieve great heights.

As H.W Longfellow once said:

                    "The heights by great men reached and kept

                     Were not attained by sudden flight,

                     But they, while their companions slept,
                     
                     Were toiling upward in the night."
